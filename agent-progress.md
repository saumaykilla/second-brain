# Agent Progress — ProjectBrain

## Verified state

Harness skeleton is in place. No application code has been scaffolded.

The product contract is `docs/plans/2026-09-26-002-feat-projectbrain-dead-end-memory-plan.md`. Fourteen features are registered, and every feature is `not_started`.

Stack this repo is held to:

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Cloud: AWS

OpenAI and OpenRouter are model providers called by the API. They are not a second system of record.

Confirmed product direction:

- ProjectBrain remembers what a team decided, what failed, and why.
- Dead-End Memory is the demo: warn with proof, answer with citations, reopen a dead end when conditions change, and promote a harness version only when evals improve.
- The seeded story is Orbit, a team task app, ingested through the real pipeline.
- The memory graph and the nightly AWS reflection job are registered after the demo path.

## Next best action

Begin `f-aws-01` by marking it `in_progress`, reading `docs/f-aws-01.md`, and creating an implementation-ready technical plan before scaffolding code.

## In progress

None.

## Known risks

- The Next.js app, Node.js API, MongoDB connection, and AWS deployment are not scaffolded yet.
- `./init.sh` checks harness integrity now. App checks start once `package.json` exists.
- OpenAI, OpenRouter, MongoDB Atlas, Slack, and AWS accounts are not configured in this repository.
- The retired collaboration-suite plan and its screen images are no longer requirements. Do not restore them as product scope.
- Graph view, pull-request comments, voice transcription, and nightly reflection are later than the demo path. Starting them first would skip the warning, the citation, and the measured harness change.

## Session log

### 2026-09-26 — ProjectBrain screen designs

- Added nine desktop references in `design/` for the lab-notebook UI: timeline, dead-end detail, ask, check, graph, harness lab, impact, and the Slack warning.
- Indexed them in `design/screens.md`.
- No feature was marked `in_progress`. No application code was written.

### 2026-09-26 — ProjectBrain replaces the previous product plan

- Retired the collaboration-suite contract, its eleven feature specs, and the generated screen images.
- Added the ProjectBrain Dead-End Memory contract.
- Registered fourteen features, from platform foundation through nightly reflection. None is `in_progress`.
- No application code was implemented.

### 2026-09-26 — Product UI reference screens

- Generated desktop screen images for the retired product direction.
- Those images were removed when the product contract changed.

### 2026-09-26 — Harness skeleton

- Added `AGENTS.md`, `init.sh`, `agent-progress.md`, `feature_list.json`, `docs/`, and `clean-state-checklist.md`.
- No feature is `in_progress`.
